# Step 1: Identify Relevant Policies
# Gather policies from various sources such as government documents, industry reports, academic papers, and company guidelines.
# Example sources: EU's AI Ethics Guidelines, Google's AI Principles, and the Asilomar AI Principles.

# Step 2: Define Data Categories
# Policy Text: The raw text of policies for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
# Key Concepts: Extracted concepts such as definitions of misuse, prohibited use cases, ethical guidelines, etc.
# Entities: Identify specific entities (e.g., types of AI systems, stakeholders, prohibited actions) mentioned in the policies.

# Step 3: Data Extraction
# Text Parsing: Use NLP techniques to parse the policy documents.
# Named Entity Recognition (NER): Apply NER to identify and extract relevant entities (e.g., AI technologies, regulatory bodies, misuse categories) mentioned in the policies.
# Topic Modeling: Apply topic modeling techniques (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify key themes and topics within the policy documents.

def extract_text(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()
    return text

def parse_text(text):
    # Tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatization
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    tagged_tokens = pos_tag(tokens)
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    lemmatized_tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token, pos_tag[1]) for token in tagged_tokens]
    return lemmatized_tokens

def extract_entities(text):
    # Named Entity Recognition
    entities = nltk.ne_chunk(tagged_tokens)
    return entities

def topic_modeling(texts):
    # Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)
    lda_model = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=10)
    lda_model.fit(tfidf)
    return lda_model

# Step 4: Annotation and Labeling
# Manual Annotation: Depending on the complexity and nuance of the policies, manually annotate sections of text to categorize them into specific data types (e.g., misuse scenarios, compliance requirements, ethical principles).
# Supervised Learning: Use supervised learning techniques to train models to automatically classify policy text into predefined categories based on your dataset's objectives.

def annotate_text(text, categories):
    # Manual annotation
    annotated_text = []
    for category in categories:
        annotated_text.append((text, category))
    return annotated_text

def train_model(X, y):
    # Supervised learning
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model

# Step 5: Dataset Structuring
# Schema Design: Define a structured format for your dataset, such as JSON or CSV, that incorporates the extracted data categories (e.g., policy text, entities, categories).
# Data Normalization: Ensure consistency in how data is represented across the dataset (e.g., standardize entity names, use consistent labels for policy types).

def structure_dataset(data, schema):
    # Structuring the dataset
    structured_data = []
    for item in data:
        structured_item = {}
        for key, value in schema.items():
            structured_item[key] = item[value]
        structured_data.append(structured_item)
    return structured_data

# Step 6: Validation and Quality Control
# Human Review: Conduct manual validation to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the dataset.
# Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, correct errors, and handle inconsistencies in the dataset.

def validate_dataset(dataset):
    # Manual validation
    pass

def clean_dataset(dataset):
    # Data cleaning
    pass

# Step 7: Dataset Publication
# Documentation: Provide clear documentation describing the dataset's purpose, contents, and potential use cases.
# Distribution: Publish the dataset through platforms like GitHub, Kaggle, or academic repositories to facilitate access and usage by the AI research community.

def publish_dataset(dataset, documentation, platform):
    # Publishing the dataset
    pass

# Example usage
policies = ['policy1.txt', 'policy2.txt', 'policy3.txt']
